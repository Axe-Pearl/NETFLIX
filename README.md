### Aim of the Project - 
To clone the Netflix that is a subscription-based streaming service

### Steps of the Process - 
I divided the Project into 3 different phases - 

**1. Observation:**
In this Phase, I observed the website I was cloning closely, observed its User Interface and all the features it provides, its robustness, and learned about its response against the traffic.

**2.  Planning:**
I noted down all the features and all the requirements for building the website , decided the best suitable tech stack I should use according to my skills and the robustness of the website. 

**3. Development -**
I started developing the website in this phase, I adopted the MVC Model (Model, View, Controller) to handle the specific part of the application separately.
Further, I again divided this phase into two different sub-phases: 

- Backend: I started developing the backend of the website first, using backend technologies, I write the code to handle the API (handling all the requests and responses), made the website secure and authenticated by hashing the user's password, and used JWT token.

- Frontend - In this sub-phase,I designed the user interface that looks so close to the actual website I was cloning. Then finally I integrated the Frontend and Backend to make the website work.

### Features -
- JWT ( jsonwebtoken ) token has been used for Authentication and Authorization. 
- Userâ€™s password will be kept secure by hashing technique provided by bcryptjs.
- ContextAPI and useReducer used for data transfer between React components and handling State.
- Users can filter movies according to Genre, series or non-series.
- It facilitate to watch movies on full screen.
- Users can also keep hovering movie lists to play them
